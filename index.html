        Netwroking <br>Networking is like a giant web connecting people from all walks of life. It's about building
        relationships, much like a cricket team or a kitchen staff. Each connection is a team member, and you're the
        captain or head chef, guiding these relationships. Just like in cricket or a kitchen, each connection has a role
        to play. Some might provide you with opportunities, others with advice or support. It's all about nurturing
        these relationships and making the most out of them. Networking is not just about taking, but also about giving.
        You have to contribute to your network, just like a cricket player contributes to their team or a chef to their
        kitchen. It's a give-and-take that strengthens these bonds over time. Networking is a powerful tool that can
        open doors to new opportunities, just like a well-coordinated cricket team can win matches, or a well-run
        kitchen can produce delicious meals. It's all about teamwork, leadership, and building strong, beneficial
        relationships!
